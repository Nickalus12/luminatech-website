---

### ROI Calculator Formula

```
Annual Time Saved (hours) = Current Monthly Reporting Hours × 12 - (Automated Review Time × 12)
Labor Cost Savings = Annual Time Saved × Burdened Hourly Rate
Inventory Optimization = Slow-Moving Inventory Identified × Carrying Cost % (5-10%)
Dead Stock Recovery = One-Time Value (if identified within first 90 days)

Total Annual Savings = Labor Cost Savings + Inventory Optimization + Dead Stock Recovery
Payback Months = Total Investment ÷ (Total Annual Savings ÷ 12)

- **$245,000/year** (labor + pick errors only)

**Realistic Scenario:**
- **$272,600/year** (includes overtime elimination and shipping errors)

---

### Payback Period

**Net Investment:** $6,000
**Annual Savings (Conservative):** $245,000
**Monthly Savings:** $20,417

**Payback Period:** ($6,000 ÷ $20,417) = **0.29 months (9 days)**

**Realistic Scenario:**
**Payback Period:** ($6,000 ÷ $22,717) = **0.26 months (8 days)**

---

### 3-Year ROI

**Total Investment (3 years):**
- Initial: $6,000
- No ongoing costs (rules run automatically)
- **3-Year Total: $6,000**

**Total Savings (3 years) - Conservative:**
- Year 1-3: $245,000 × 3 = **$735,000**

**3-Year Net Gain:** $735,000 - $6,000 = **$729,000**

**3-Year ROI:** ($729,000 ÷ $6,000) × 100 = **12,150%**

**Total Savings (3 years) - Realistic:**
- Year 1-3: $272,600 × 3 = **$817,800**

**3-Year Net Gain (Realistic):** $817,800 - $6,000 = **$811,800**

**3-Year ROI (Realistic):** ($811,800 ÷ $6,000) × 100 = **13,530%**

### Carrier Validation Sub-Model

**Implementation Cost:** $3,000

**Time Savings:**
- Prevents 100 shipping errors/year (orders without carrier)
- Time to fix per error: 15 minutes
- **Annual Time Saved:** 100 × 15 min ÷ 60 = 25 hours
- Labor value: 25 × $25 = **$625/year**

**Cost Savings:**
- Shipping integration failures prevented: 100/year
- Cost per failure (customer service, re-work, goodwill): $120
- **Annual Savings:** 100 × $120 = **$12,000/year**

**Payback Period:** ($3,000 ÷ $12,000) × 12 = **3 months**

**3-Year ROI:** (($12,000 × 3 - $3,000) ÷ $3,000) × 100 = **1,100%**

### ROI Calculator Formula

```
Daily Pick Tickets = Avg Number of Picks per Day
Time Saved per Pick = Previous Pick Time - Optimized Pick Time
Daily Time Saved = Daily Pick Tickets × Time Saved per Pick
Annual Labor Savings = Daily Time Saved × Business Days × Burdened Picker Rate

Pick Error Rate Reduction = Previous Error % - New Error %
Daily Errors Prevented = Daily Pick Tickets × Pick Error Rate Reduction
Cost per Pick Error = Re-Pick Labor + Delay Cost + Customer Impact
Annual Error Savings = Daily Errors Prevented × Business Days × Cost per Pick Error

Capacity Increase = (New Daily Capacity - Old Daily Capacity)
Overtime Hours Eliminated = Capacity Increase ÷ Productivity Gain
Overtime Savings = Overtime Hours Eliminated × Overtime Rate × Weeks per Year

Total Annual Savings = Labor Savings + Error Savings + Overtime Savings
Payback Months = Total Investment ÷ (Total Annual Savings ÷ 12)
3-Year ROI = ((3-Year Savings - 3-Year Investment) ÷ 3-Year Investment) × 100
```
