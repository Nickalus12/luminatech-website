The clock is ticking. Epicor's Kinetic 2026.1 release (May 2026) discontinues the Classic UI. The final on-premises feature release hits in 2028.1, with active support ending June 30, 2029. If you're running Prophet 21 on-prem today, migration isn't a question of *if* -- it's a question of *when* and *how well prepared you are when it happens*.

I've been working inside P21 daily for over a decade. I've seen what happens when companies rush a migration without preparation, and I've seen what happens when they plan methodically. The difference isn't subtle -- it's the difference between a two-week transition and a six-month firefight.

This checklist is what I'd hand you if you hired me tomorrow. Work through it in order.

## Phase 1: Assess What You Have (Weeks 1-2)

Before you can plan a migration, you need an honest inventory of your current environment. Most companies dramatically underestimate how customized their P21 installation is.

### Customization Audit

Run this query against your P21 database to get a starting count of business rules:

```sql
-- Count all active business rules by type
SELECT
  rule_type,
  COUNT(*) AS rule_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN active_flag = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS active_rules
FROM business_rule_header
GROUP BY rule_type
ORDER BY rule_count DESC;
```

Then document each customization in a spreadsheet with these columns:

| Column | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| **Rule/Customization Name** | Identification |
| **What It Does** | Business purpose (not technical description) |
| **Who Uses It** | Which department depends on this |
| **Frequency** | How often it fires (daily? every transaction?) |
| **Cloud Compatible?** | Can this work in SaaS, or does it need redesign? |
| **Priority** | Must-have vs. nice-to-have |

<div class="callout callout-warning">
<strong>The hidden customizations:</strong> Don't forget SSRS reports, Crystal Reports, custom stored procedures, SQL Agent jobs, third-party integrations, and DynaChange configurations. These are the ones that break silently during migration because nobody documented them.
</div>

### Integration Inventory

List every system that talks to P21:

- **eCommerce platforms** (connections, API calls, data sync frequency)
- **EDI providers** (trading partners, document types)
- **CRM systems** (customer data sync, order history feeds)
- **WMS/barcode systems** (RF guns, pick/pack/ship workflows)
- **Accounting/GL** (journal entry exports, account mapping)
- **Shipping platforms** (carrier integrations, label printing)
- **Custom dashboards or BI tools** (direct database connections)

For each integration, document: the connection method (direct SQL, API, flat file, middleware), the direction (push, pull, bidirectional), and the owner (who maintains it).

### User Workflow Documentation

This is the step everyone skips. Sit with your key users -- order entry, purchasing, warehouse, accounting -- and watch them work for an hour each. Document:

- Custom keyboard shortcuts and macros
- Saved searches and custom views
- Workarounds they use for things P21 "doesn't do well"
- Reports they run daily/weekly and what decisions they drive

These workflows are your acceptance criteria for the migration. If the cloud version breaks someone's daily routine, you'll hear about it immediately.

## Phase 2: Evaluate Cloud Readiness (Weeks 3-4)

### Infrastructure Assessment

Answer these questions:

1. **What's your current SQL Server version?** Kinetic Cloud runs on specific versions. Older databases may need an intermediate upgrade.
2. **How large is your database?** Get the actual size:

```sql
-- Database size and data file details
SELECT
  DB_NAME() AS DatabaseName,
  CAST(SUM(size * 8.0 / 1024) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS SizeMB,
  CAST(SUM(size * 8.0 / 1024 / 1024) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS SizeGB
FROM sys.database_files;
```

3. **What's your internet bandwidth?** Cloud P21 needs reliable, low-latency connectivity. If your warehouse is on a 50Mbps connection with 80ms latency, your RF guns will feel sluggish.
4. **Do you have a VPN or SD-WAN?** Multiple locations need consistent, secure connectivity to the cloud environment.

### Business Rule Compatibility Review

Not all business rules survive the cloud migration as-is. Here's what to watch for:

**Usually compatible:**
- Rules that use standard P21 triggers and conditions
- Rules that reference standard P21 tables and fields
- Simple validation and calculation rules

**Needs review or redesign:**
- Rules with direct SQL Server Agent job dependencies
- Rules that reference file system paths (UNC paths, local drives)
- Rules that call external DLLs or COM objects
- Rules that depend on SQL Server-level features (linked servers, CLR assemblies)
- Rules with timing dependencies on other rules or scheduled tasks

**Will not work as-is:**
- Anything that writes to or reads from the local file system
- Direct database triggers (not P21 business rules, actual SQL triggers)
- Custom Windows services that interact with P21 tables
- Third-party tools that connect via ODBC directly to the database

<div class="callout callout-info">
<strong>The extensibility question:</strong> Epicor's SaaS extensibility framework is different from on-prem customization. Some things that were easy on-prem (write a stored procedure, done) require a different approach in the cloud. Factor in redesign time for these.
</div>

## Phase 3: Plan the Migration (Weeks 5-8)

### Timeline Construction

Work backwards from your target go-live date:

- **Go-live minus 12 weeks:** Begin parallel testing (run both systems)
- **Go-live minus 8 weeks:** User acceptance testing starts
- **Go-live minus 6 weeks:** Integration testing with all connected systems
- **Go-live minus 4 weeks:** Data migration dry run (full dataset)
- **Go-live minus 2 weeks:** Final data validation and signoff
- **Go-live minus 1 week:** Cutover rehearsal with key users
- **Go-live:** Execute cutover plan, war room staffed

### Data Migration Strategy

Decide your approach:

1. **Big bang:** Everything migrates at once over a weekend. Simpler but higher risk.
2. **Phased:** Migrate modules or locations incrementally. Lower risk but longer timeline and more complex.

For either approach, you need:

- A data cleansing plan (archive old data, fix duplicates, standardize formats)
- A mapping document for any schema changes
- A rollback plan if the migration fails
- A data validation checklist (counts, totals, sample record verification)

### Training Plan

Don't underestimate this. The Kinetic UI looks and feels different from Classic. Even though the underlying data and workflows are the same, your users will feel disoriented.

- **Power users:** 4-8 hours of hands-on training, two weeks before go-live
- **Standard users:** 2-4 hours of role-specific training, one week before go-live
- **Warehouse/mobile users:** Hands-on practice with new RF/mobile interface
- **Create a "cheat sheet"** mapping old UI navigation to new UI navigation

## Phase 4: Execute (Weeks 9-12+)

### Pre-Migration Checklist

Run through this the week before your migration date:

- [ ] All business rules documented and cloud-ready versions tested
- [ ] All integrations tested against cloud environment
- [ ] Data migration dry run completed successfully
- [ ] User acceptance testing signed off by department leads
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and rehearsed
- [ ] Support escalation contacts confirmed (Epicor, your consultant, internal IT)
- [ ] Communication sent to all users with go-live date, training schedule, and support contacts
- [ ] Vendor/customer-facing systems tested (EDI, eCommerce, portals)

### Go-Live Day Protocol

- **5:00 AM:** Begin cutover -- take on-prem system offline, begin final data sync
- **7:00 AM:** Data validation spot checks (order counts, inventory levels, AR/AP balances)
- **8:00 AM:** Cloud environment opened to power users for validation
- **9:00 AM:** All users online, support team stationed in each department
- **12:00 PM:** First checkpoint -- collect issues, prioritize fixes
- **5:00 PM:** End of day assessment -- go/no-go for Day 2
- **Week 1:** Daily 15-minute standup to triage issues
- **Week 2-4:** Twice-weekly check-ins, transition to normal support

## What Not to Do

I've seen these mistakes derail migrations. Avoid them:

1. **Don't migrate and customize simultaneously.** Get to the cloud first, stabilize, then optimize. Trying to do both creates chaos.
2. **Don't skip the dry run.** A practice migration reveals problems you cannot predict. Always do at least one full rehearsal.
3. **Don't forget the reports.** Custom SSRS reports are the #1 thing that breaks during migration. Test every report your finance team uses.
4. **Don't ignore your users' anxiety.** Change is hard. Over-communicate the timeline, provide training, and be available for questions. The technical migration will succeed or fail based on user adoption.
5. **Don't go it alone if you're short-staffed.** A migration consultant who knows P21 can compress your timeline dramatically and catch issues before they become emergencies.

## Need a Migration Partner?

I help distributors plan and execute P21 cloud migrations without the chaos. From initial assessment through go-live and beyond, I bring the perspective of someone who uses P21 every single day -- not just someone who implements it and leaves.
